	<p><!-- Insert text here -->Have you ever had one of those humbling moments when you suddenly realize you have certain faults that are holding you back? We’d like to hope those moments are few and far between, but if you are open to them they can actually be incredible teaching tools that help you grow. One of these moments is exactly what lead me to DBC and motivated me to make the most of my time here.</p>
	<p>To be honest, I’ve never really thought much about patterns in my thinking or how my mind typically works. I always assume I look at most things fairly and objectively. But in DBC’s prep work I read about the ideas of Thinking Styles and the Fixed vs. Growth mindset and immediately saw some of these patterns in my own thinking. I realized I wasn’t necessarily approaching problems in the most productive way.</p>
	<p>A “fixed mindset” is the idea that knowledge and intelligence is static and that each person is born with specific skills. To people with fixed mindsets, success means manifesting these skills. But this can lead to the tendency to avoid challenges, strive only for external approval, and not grow and learn – basically become stagnant. Someone with a “growth mindset,” on the other hand, believes that no person is more capable than another, that new skills can be learned through embracing challenges, and that intelligence can be developed with hard work.</p>

	<p>When I read about these two mindsets that I noticed some unsettling fixed mindset tendencies in myself. Before applying to DBC, I had become bored with my work and somewhat pessimistic about my occupation. I was working in journalism and marketing because I gravitated toward writing and working with ideas. But I was starting to find the work rote and uninspiring. I became somewhat bitter toward my engineer friends who were loving their work. Because writing jobs were all I knew, I only sought opportunities that reinforced this view of myself as a writer. In essence, I wasn’t growing.</p>
	<p>I also didn’t realize I had a specific thinking style until I took the Gregoric Thinking Styles test. As an Abstract Sequential thinker, I like to work with big ideas in a logical way. As a Concrete Sequential thinker, I like working in a structured environment where I know what the guidelines are. Although I don’t fit squarely in these thinking styles and there is plenty of crossover – I consider myself creative, diplomatic, and empathetic, for example – I definitely see some overarching patterns.</p>
	<p>The biggest challenge in Phase 0 has been dealing with an unstructured environment. When working mostly on my own, it’s hard to know if I’m on the right track toward learning something. I find it easy to follow instructions, and although there is a set curriculum during DBC we are mostly left to ourselves to figure out problems. As a Concrete Sequential thinker, this lack of a structured environment can be unsettling.</p>
	<p>But recognizing my thinking patterns means I can see how they can hurt me. For example, my Concrete Sequential characteristics make me adverse to freely experimenting and playing with a problem – I just want to be straightfoward in solving it. But this experimental strategy can expose me to new ways of looking at the problem. I need to be aware of my tendencies and stay open to new ways of learning.</p>
